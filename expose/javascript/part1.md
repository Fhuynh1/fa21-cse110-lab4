4. There is an error because result was declared using let and that means that result can only be accessed within the block it was defined. Thus, result can only be accessed inside the if statement and line 13 is trying to access result while being outside of the if statement.
5. There is an error because result is a const variable and that means that it cannot be changed. However, on line 7 the code is trying to change the value of result.
6. There is an error because of the same reason as 5.
